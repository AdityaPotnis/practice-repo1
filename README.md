# NIFTY Time-Series ML Pipeline (Spark + GitHub Actions)

This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for NIFTY index data using PySpark, focused on correct time-series modeling practices rather than trading profitability.

The goal is to learn how prediction pipelines work in production:

1. data ingestion
2. rolling model training
3. future prediction
4. delayed evaluation (RMSE / accuracy)
5. CI-driven automation
